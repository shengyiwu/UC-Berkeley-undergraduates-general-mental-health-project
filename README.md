# UC Berkeley Undergraduates General Mental Health Project
## Shengyi Wu
## Introduction:
Throughout my two years in college, more and more students around me say that they are
suffering mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, bulimia, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. Indeed, according to the Counseling Center Directors’ Survey in 2014, there is a
nationwide agreement that college students are having increasingly severe psychological problems
year by year. However, when I asked my friends who suffer mental illness whether they have tried
any mental health services on campus, the responses that I got were consistent: no. Through this
research, I investigated UC Berkeley undergraduates’ general mental health condition and the use
of on campus mental health resources. Using data collected through a questionnaire, I analyzed
students’ general mental health and why they don’t use mental health services.
